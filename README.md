===========

Visualizes data from Facebook as a graph implemented using d3 js library.


Joseph Caluza (A10078691) and Tyler Lopez (A10232156)

Concepts used in UI:

1) Visibility: So that user's were aware of when they were, or were not, using the demographic visualization, we used a button to create a pop up window within the home page which displays the information requested. The pop up is set into focus while the background, being the main page, is darkened so that users understand that they are still within the same page, but being shown the requested information in a non-invasive way. For the friend demographic we created, we used text to display what the user was seeing in the graph below, then present the user with two additional graphs displaying that same information as well as expand upon it. At the bottom of the graph we also created a legend to help with color and information coordination.

2) Feedback: When the users press the button to call the friend demographic, a spinner was included to help users understand that the information they requested is being calculated and will shortly be displayed.

*Note to TA: If you are concerned that the Github was pushed into after the deadline,
please note the only change to the submission was to this README. The README was initially
stored onto Tyler's Github account and we forgot to bring it over to Joseph's. To confirm 
that we did submit the README on time, you can view it in Tyler's Github at the following
